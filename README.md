# Data Analytics notes

Miscellaneous notes made during study for [Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/data-analytics-certificate).

## Notes on notes

1. I typically only note things that I suspect I'll forget, or that don't make sense immediately. As such, my notes are only a small subset of the course's full content.
2. Each folder is a course, containing a `.md` per "module".
